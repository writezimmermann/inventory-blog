For 2-3 years I think my favourite brand to follow has been [A Kind of Guise](https://akindofguise.com). I dont recall how I saw their first piece of 
clothing or how I discovered the brand but I remember the instant trust I felt in the brand through their inteliggent travel forward
editorials. Elevated basics is a term that gets thrown around by every brand these days but no one embodied that sentiment like AKOG. 
And best of all, they looked like they where having fun whilst sticking to very obvious principles in selecting nice fabrics and 
producing ethically and locally depending on collection. Every new lookbook is not only about the clothes but how they reflect
the culture that they represent. Each lookbook takes its inspiration from a location and the inhabitants. So the clothes instantly
show their flexibility and appeal by being shot and styled on real people. [A Kind of Guise](https://akindofguise.com).

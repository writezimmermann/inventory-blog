I remember the first time I really noticed the Rolex Datejust. Like many, it was after seeing it on a friend’s wrist—Phil America, a charismatic artist passing through Switzerland. He wore a classic two-tone Datejust: light dial, jubilee bracelet. It was timeless.

A few months later, I found my own "birth year" Datejust on eBay—a linen dial model—for just over $1,000. At the time, it felt like a lot to spend on a watch I didn’t need. But I wore it every single day for years. It even inspired friends to get one too. It’s funny to say, but that watch made me feel like an adult. Like I had, in some way, arrived.

What really drew me in was the mechanical heart ticking inside. I didn’t know much about watches, but seeing something lifeless start ticking with a few circular shakes? That felt like magic. And the way light dances off the fluted bezel still brings me joy—tiny flickers of sparkle that never get old.

Anyway, the point I’m trying to make is that for years, I was perfectly content with the DJ. During COVID, like many, I fell down an endless rabbit hole of watches and the stories around them. Thankfully, living in Zürich, I could try on most of what I saw online. It’s been a few years of buying and selling watches, and funnily enough—without fail—I keep coming back to the Datejust. I’ve gone through Cartiers, Heuers, a Patek, an Omega—you name it. And after all that, the watch I was most happy with was a Day-Date, which is essentially a Datejust in precious metal.

So for those of you contemplating a first watch—you’re welcome to go on the journey. Maybe start with a more affordable Tudor that gives you a similar look for a fraction of the cost. Or you could save yourself the time and just get the watch you’ll end up wanting anyway: the Datejust.

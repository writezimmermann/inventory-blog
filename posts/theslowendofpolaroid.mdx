The only way to start writing about Polaroids is to admit there's no way to fully explain my love for the format.
Polaroid prints—whether framed in minimalist black or centered on a blank book page—have always pulled at me. I even briefly collected Self Service magazine, partly because its editor clearly shared the same affection. The square format and distinctive color rendering have drawn in everyone from iconic photographers to casual fans.

Fujifilm’s Instax, while more color-accurate, just doesn’t hit the same. The wide format feels awkward—less charming, somehow.

That’s why it was hard to part with my Polaroid SLR 680. Undoubtedly the best Polaroid ever made: a stunningly sharp SLR, a joy to shoot with, and the source of so many beautiful images. For a while, my Ricoh GR and film Leicas stayed in the drawer—I was that happy with it.

Especially now, when photography feels increasingly synthetic. Filters, AI edits, fake bokeh—it all makes you wonder if a photo is still a photo. With the SLR 680, everything was real. Each frame: unique, uneditable, imperfect—and all the more beautiful for it. Shooting was a process: unfold the camera, protect the shot from light, wait. But the result was honest. Tangible. True.

Eventually, I had to send my SLR 680 to the U.S. for servicing—the film kept jamming. And with each shot costing around 2 CHF, reliability matters. Sadly, even after service, it didn’t work. So I sold it, hoping Polaroid would soon release a worthy modern successor.

That was three years ago.

And still—nothing. No camera has come close to the SLR 680, which, I’ve since learned, came out in 1982—the year before I was born. It’s disheartening. The format is brilliant, but the hardware is letting it down. Too unreliable. Too inconsistent. And that's a shame, because it should be thriving.

Here’s hoping Polaroid pulls through with a camera that does the format justice.

The only way to begin writing anything about Polaroids is to admit that theres no way to explain the utter love I have for the format. 
Polaroid prints framed in little black frames or books that have polaroids neatly printed in the middle of 
an otherwise barren page have always appealed to me. Even briefly collected Self service magazine because their 
editor clearly had the same affinity to the format. The square image and color rendering has amassed countles fans 
from high profile photographers to hte masses. 

And although Fujifilm have their Instax format with colors that are more honest to reality there is something
offputting about the wide format they where forced to adopt. It just isnt quite as nice for whatever reason. 

Given all that I recently had to sell of my beloved Polaroid SLR 680. Undoubtledly the greatest Polaroid camera
ever made. A BEAUTIFUL sharp SLR that was a joy to use and provided so many wonderful polaroids in the time I had it. 
There was a time my Ricoh GR and film Leica's sat in a drawer because I was so happy with the results of the Polaroid. 

Especially given that modern photography is losing its identity to algorithms and apps that instantly throw a filter
on your photos, remove a unwanted background character or add faux blurring to fake depth of field. All these 
things makes one question if a photo is really a photo anymore. It can be adapted and twisted so easily gone
are the days that it was purely a reflection of the reality snapped in the second the shutter closed. 
The SLR680 was unwieldy to open and the new light sensitivity of impossible project film meant you had to cradle shots
and throw them into darkness the moment you took them. But what you got was worth it. A moment in time developed
into a small one of a kind object that you couldnt alter or improve. It was just as it was and that was 
the beauty of it. It was honest. It was perfect in its imperfection. 

So long story short I had sent the Polaroid camera in for service all away to America because the film was getting stuck. And at the 
cost of the film these days you need to rely on the camera to deliver because its about 2.- chf everytime you click the$
shutter. 

The camera came back after the service and sadly still wasnt working. So I reluctantly sold it thinking that it was only a 
matter of time before Polaroid made a modern camera that would replace the SLR 680.

That was 3 years ago. And it looks like there is still. No Polaroid on the market that comes close to the SLR680 which 
according to my research was released a year before I was born in 1982. Ultimately it makes me sad. A format
that so clearly works is slowly losing a fan base because the hardwear just isnt there. Film jamming, 
unreliable exposure. Too hit and miss for a format that you need to be able to rely on when you 
decide to take it out and use it. So here's hoping Polaroid comes through in the cluth and release
a camera worthy of the format.
